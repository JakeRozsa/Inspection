      <h3 class="conc-header">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>After removing certain areas on the roof, i verified that the roof was completed wrong. Ice and water shield
        was
        not used properly in the valleys and not at all around the skylights. The valley metal was terribly thin, not
        nailed in to the existing side of the roof, or sealed off to its multiple pieces with silicon. The skylights
        flashing was done incorrectly; it used step flashing on the side where L metal should have been used and
        vice-a-versa. The skylight was completely buried underneath the shingles meaning that whenever it rains, the
        run
        of had direct access to run underneath the shingles and into the wood of the roof and finally into the house.
        There were some small things that were done correctly but, ultimately, the roof was already leaking due to lack
        of roof knowledge or installer incompetance. </p>
